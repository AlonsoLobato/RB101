## PEDAC: Example 2 - 

### P: Understanding the Problem

*This is probably the most important step in terms of stabilsinh a frame of reference for understanding the problem and determining a solution*
*We will need to refere to this step and refactor things several times through the process*
*Spend enough time, don't rush this step*

**Steps**

- Establishing the rules / define the boundaries of the problem
  - Assess available information about the problem
  - Restate Explicit requirements (declared in the problem description)
  - Identify Implicit (not declared but deductible through test cases, questions, our own understanding, etc.)


### E: Examples and Test Cases

*We may be provided with some examples, all or none at all, and therefore have to created them ourselves*
*Test cases are examples using the specific syntax of a programming language and structured in such a way as to test particular input against an expected output*

- Can confirm or refute assumptions
- Help answer questions about implicit requirements
- Act as assertions which help to codify the rules and boundaries


### D: Data Structures

- Help reason with data logically
- Help interact with data at implementational level
- Thinking in terms of data structures is part of problem solving
- Data structures closely linked to algorithm
  - Set of steps from input to ouput
    - Involves structuring data in a certain way

    
### A: Algorithm

- A logical sequence of steps for accomplishing a task or objective
  - Closely linked to data structures 
  - Series of steps to structure data to produce the required output
- Stay abstract / high-level
  - no implementation details like reference to methods, code or formal pseudocode at this level
  - we can and should revisit the algorithm during the implementation steps to: 
    - updated or 
    - make implementation level notes
- Its very possible that some of the steps in the algorithm are complex enough as to be treated as separate sub-problems
  - in this case, we'd repeat the whole PEDAC process with the sub-problem, treating it as a separate problem    


### C: Implementing a solution in Code

- Translate the solution algorithm into code 
- Think about the algorith in the context of programming language
  - Language features and constrains
  - Characteristics of data structures
  - Built in functions / methods
  - Syntax and conding patterns
- Create test cases
- Code with intent
